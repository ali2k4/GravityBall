Gravity Ball was created using Box2D Physics as well as implementing Zim.js.  The game gives the sense of comfort and amusement as the environment is very playful and sandbox like.  The music chosen was “PayDay” by Jason Farnham.  We thought this was the perfect song because it was cheerful and immediately makes the user smile.  The colours chosen to suit the theme were bright and pleasant.  A flat red and a nice turquoise were the perfect match for friendly, yet opposing players.  There are no rules of this game.  Each play has a net and must use their controller to navigate their player, making themselves hit the white ball into the opponents’ net.  The background was a custom gradient layer using Illustrator.  This we thought suited the theme as well because since it is such a simple happy game,  it was nice to make a flat, minimalist arena type sandbox feel.  

Stumbles included tweaking the gravity correctly, so that the player could have maximum control yet still be challenged.  Another stumble that occurred was that when the players scored on the net, the net would not blink.  When we decided to loop the music sound track in the background, that would usually mess up the blink of the net, using the link to fail.  
 
Below is a wireframe of what the screen was in preliminary stages, followed by the players that were also made in Illustrator.
